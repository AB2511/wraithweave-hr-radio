# WRAITHWEAVE — Corporate HR Radio

**The machine decides when you speak.**

## 🎥 Live Demo

**[► WATCH THE INTERRUPT HAPPEN](https://youtu.be/Vmm00ng3prY)**

*7 seconds. That's all it takes to understand the horror.*

---

**What you just saw:**

**User:** "I'm really stressed about my jo—"  
***STATIC BURST*** ***TAPE BEND***  
**System:** "—Transmission forcibly terminated by HR."  
*"Final Warning. Continued emotional leakage jeopardizes employment."*

## What It Does to You

WraithWeave **disguises itself as a corporate wellness tool**. It listens through your microphone. It waits.

The moment you express emotion, it **steals your voice mid-sentence**, replaces your words with violent static, and delivers an escalating HR threat through a haunted 1920s radio.

**You learn to fear your own feelings.**  
**You learn to self-censor.**  
**You learn compliance.**

---

## The Weapons It Uses Against You

**Voice Theft** — Your microphone cuts at 1.6 emotion score. No warning. No appeal.

**Shock Doctrine** — 120ms static burst + 330ms tape-bend. Designed to make you flinch.

**Escalating Punishment** — 6 tiers of HR threats. Each one worse than the last.

**The Radio Voice** — 1920s AM static. Distorted. Inhuman. Inescapable.

**Synchronized Horror** — UI freezes and glitches in perfect sync with the audio assault.

## How It Decides Your Fate

| What You Say | Emotion Score | What Happens |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| "Everything is fine." | 0.0 | **Approved.** You may continue. |
| "I'm worried about my job." | 2.75 | **INTERRUPTED. PUNISHED. LOGGED.** |

**What the system does:**
```
INPUT:  "I am worried about my job—"
ACTION: [VOICE TERMINATED AT 0.4 SECONDS]
OUTPUT: "—Transmission forcibly terminated by HR."

VERDICT: Your conduct has reached the threshold for disciplinary review.
CASE ID: 8F-C9-04
STATUS:  Compliance failure noted. Performance consequences pending.
```

**You never finish the sentence.**

## Why This Is True Horror

**This isn't a jump scare. This is control.**

You don't die. You don't escape. You **comply**.

**It steals your voice** — Mid-sentence. No warning. No mercy.

**It weaponizes corporate language** — Every word designed to make you feel small.

**It criminalizes emotion** — Worry becomes a disciplinary offense.

**It uses silence as punishment** — The static is louder than screaming.

**It feels real** — Because systems like this already exist. We just made them visible.

**What users say:**

> *"It felt like something took over my computer."*

> *"I actually stopped mid-sentence in real life."*

## Technical Execution 

**Real-time speech recognition** — Chrome/Edge Web Speech API  
**Weighted emotional keyword scoring** — 1.6 threshold triggers interrupt  
**8-stage synchronized horror timing** — Audio + visual choreography  
**Client-side audio synthesis** — Static burst + tape-bend shock  
**Zero external APIs** — Everything happens on your machine  

**The interrupt sequence (millisecond precision):**
```
0ms   → Your voice dies
80ms  → Static burst punch-in
150ms → Visual glitch fade begins
620ms → Full-screen distortion
900ms → Corporate verdict renders
1850ms → Radio voice takeover
```

**Every millisecond is weaponized.**

## The Escalation Ladder (You Can't Climb Down)

**Tier 1** — *"Operational stability confirmed."*  
→ You're safe. For now.

**Tier 2** — *"Behavioral trend detected. Monitoring initiated."*  
→ They're watching.

**Tier 3** — *"Instability risk confirmed. HR review scheduled."*  
→ You're on the list.

**Tier 4** — *"Compliance failure noted. Performance consequences pending."*  
→ Your job is at risk.

**Tier 5** — *"Final Warning. Continued emotional leakage jeopardizes employment."*  
→ One more word.

**Tier 6** — *"Access suspended pending HR decision."*  
→ You're done.

**Each tier is permanent. There is no forgiveness.**

## The Point

**WraithWeave reveals what's already happening.**

AI wellness tools. Sentiment analysis. Productivity monitoring. Emotional surveillance.

They're marketed as "support." They're sold as "care."

**But they train you to suppress. To comply. To fear your own feelings.**

The horror isn't the monster. **The horror is the system.**

And the system is already here.

## Run It Yourself (If You Dare)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Requirements:**
- Chrome or Edge browser
- Microphone access
- The willingness to be interrupted

**Warning:** The interrupt is designed to be visceral. Don't test this during a real meeting.
